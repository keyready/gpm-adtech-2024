You gave me life and you want it in return. I'm not lying, I'm not lying at all. I'd give my life for yours without looking. For I love you, Mom, I don't just love you, I'd give anything for you. Mama, know this, don't die before me. Don't scold me for these thoughts. When the crow is circling above you and you love me, ask her. Ask your mother at dawn and she'll tell you. Don't just love me, I'll give you everything in the world Mama, you just don't die before me Don't scold me for thinking that When wounds burn, we all shout, "Mama!" When wounds burn, we all shout "Mama!" I'll give you everything in the world, Mama, just give me a hand!
